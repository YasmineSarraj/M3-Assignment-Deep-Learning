# M4-Assignment-Deep-Learning
This is the portfolio of assignments for the Deep Learning module, this portfolio is submitted by Yasmine Sarraj, Nils Bayer.
In the first assignment we buit a deep learning model based on the classification of the penguin dataset. 
In the second assignement we built and evaluate 2 special types of networks neural network with Pytorch. (CNN & RNN)
